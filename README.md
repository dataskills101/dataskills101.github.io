## Welcome to Data Skills 101

This page houses a great set of resources for learning python basic and pandas intermediate skills. This site can serve as a companion to your 101 Python exercises in Kaggle and introduces you to interactive notebooks that allow you to write both text ([markdown and html](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) and code in the same notebook. The key to learning to code is to code...consistently; it's that simple. I'm excited to be a part of your journey!
