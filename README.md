## Welcome to Data Skills 101

This site houses a great set of resources for learning python basics and pandas intermediate skills. It can serve as a companion to your Python 101 Exercises in Kaggle and an introduction to interactive notebooks that allow you to write both text ([markdown and html](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) and code in the same interactive environment. The key to learning to code is to code...consistently; it's that simple. We're excited to help you launch your journey!
