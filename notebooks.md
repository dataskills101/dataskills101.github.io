#### Google Colab Coding Practice

Unlike the static review notebooks in the tools section of this site, you can make your own copy of these Colab notebooks in your own Google drive and edit them. If you already have a Github account where you store and share your work, you can even push Colab notebooks up to Github as you add your own code or eventually make new practice notebooks of your own!
